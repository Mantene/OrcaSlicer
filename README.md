## Warum ein eigenes Repo?

KX-Bridge selbst liegt unter [viewit/KX-Bridge-Release](https://gitea.it-drui.de/viewit/KX-Bridge-Release).
OrcaSlicer steht unter AGPL-3.0 — ein separates Repo hält Lizenzen, Quellherkunft und Update-Zyklen sauber getrennt.

### Belt Printer Builds

The [nightly release](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/releases/tag/nightly-builds) ships **two parallel builds**: the standard build and a belt-printer build. Both are attached to the same release — tell them apart by the filename suffix:

- **Standard** — no suffix (e.g. `OrcaSlicer_Windows_Installer_x64_nightly.exe`)
- **Belt** — `_belt` suffix (e.g. `OrcaSlicer_Windows_Installer_x64_nightly_belt.exe`)

The `_belt` builds add **experimental support for belt / conveyor (infinite-Z) printers**, where the model is sliced against a tilted belt surface instead of a flat horizontal bed. They include ready-to-use belt printer profiles, the full belt slicing pipeline (mesh rotation and G-code transforms), belt-aware support generation, and a tilted-bed preview.

> ⚠️ Belt printer support is under active development and is **not yet merged into `main`** — it currently ships only in these parallel `_belt` builds, produced from the [`belt-printer`](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/tree/belt-printer) branch. See tracking PR [#14394](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/14394) and the original documentation in [#12998](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/pull/12998).

## Linux

### Flathub (Recommended)

OrcaSlicer is available through FlatHub:

<a href='https://flathub.org/apps/com.orcaslicer.OrcaSlicer'><img width='240' alt='Download on Flathub' src='https://dl.flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png'/></a>

It can also be installed through graphical software managers (KDE Discover, GNOME Software, etc.) when Flathub is enabled. Search for **OrcaSlicer** in your software center.

### AppImage

AppImages are published for both **x86_64** and **aarch64** (ARM64). Pick the file matching your CPU — the ARM64 build has `aarch64` in its name (e.g. `OrcaSlicer_Linux_AppImage_Ubuntu2404_aarch64_*.AppImage`).

 1. Download App image from the [releases page](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/releases).
 2. Double click the downloaded file to run it.

# Klipper Note

If you're running Klipper, it's recommended to add the following configuration to your `printer.cfg` file.

```gcode
# Enable object exclusion
[exclude_object]

# Enable arcs support
[gcode_arcs]
resolution: 0.1
```

## Some Background

Open-source slicing has always been built on a tradition of collaboration and attribution. [Slic3r](https://github.com/Slic3r/Slic3r), created by Alessandro Ranellucci and the RepRap community, laid the foundation. [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer) by Prusa Research built on Slic3r and acknowledged that heritage. [Bambu Studio](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio) in turn forked from PrusaSlicer, and [SuperSlicer](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer) by @supermerill extended PrusaSlicer with community-driven enhancements. Each project carried the work of its predecessors forward, crediting those who came before.

OrcaSlicer began in that same spirit, drawing from BambuStudio, PrusaSlicer, and ideas inspired by CuraSlicer and SuperSlicer. But it has since grown far beyond its origins. Through relentless innovation — introducing advanced calibration tools, precise wall and seam control, tree supports, adaptive slicing, and hundreds of other features — OrcaSlicer has become the most widely used and actively developed open-source slicer in the 3D printing community. Many of its innovations have been adopted by other slicers, making it a driving force for the entire industry.

The OrcaSlicer logo was designed by community member [Justin Levine](https://github.com/jal-co).
